"# CardGame" 

Using the deck of cards API (https://deckofcardsapi.com/), implemented a node.js app that does the following:
 
• Creates and shuffles a deck of cards
• Draws 5 cards from the hand and prints their numbers and suits to the console
• Identifies the top scoring poker hand 
• test.js validate the code
--------------------------------
 
# Instructions

• run -> npm install
--------------------------------
